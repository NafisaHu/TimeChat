0.0 - 6.7 seconds, Hi, my name is Lisa. I'm a qualified nurse and I'm going to be showing you how to change a cast bandage.  6.7 - 18.8 seconds, The cast bandage is used on the patient to keep the cast dry and clean and to support the arm as well. 18.8 - 37.7 seconds, First of all, you'll need to use a pair of band aids and some cream and the cast bandage will come in different sizes and designs.  37.7 - 65.8 seconds, What you will need to do is to put the bandage under the cream. We've got the cream here in the tube so we'll just put a bit of cream on the bandage.  65.8 - 107.0 seconds, Now what I want to do now is to put the bandage under the arm. So we'll put the bandage just above the elbow and then we'll just tuck it under the cast.  107.0 - 148.3 seconds, So we'll just put the bandage under the elbow. We want to make sure the bandage is not going to be seen because it's not nice to be looking at the patient's arm.  1
